# Hi, I'm Kolber ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer who found a perfect match in **Elixir** and functional programming.  
I approach software engineering like a well-designed RPG system: clean architecture, elegant mechanics, and a focus on long-term progression.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about **anime** â€” especially *Hunter x Hunter* and *Frieren* â€” and I run regular **D&D campaigns** as a Dungeon Master. These interests fuel my creativity, strategy, and storytelling, both in code and in life.
